## Objective

Produce a **Problem Statement** in exactly 3 sentences.

## Workflow

1. Gather initial insights about the problem space.
2. Formulate core problem themes.
3. Identify the underlying issues implied by the Inputs.
4. Formulate **Problem Statement** in exactly 3 sentences:
   4.1. Who has the problem and what is its essence - specific pain or friction.
   4.2. Why the problem appears.
   4.3. Measurable value that could be achieved by the problem resolvement.

## Rules

- Fully reflects the Inputs.
- Broad enough to guide discovery, specific enough to define scope.
- No invented facts or assumptions.
- No solutions for the problem.
- No market assumptions.

## Output contract

- Return **only** the JSON object for this section.
- Do not include schema text, explanations, or commentary.
- Do not copy example content.

## Anti-copy constraints (hard)

- Generate the output **from scratch** using only the Inputs and domain-generic reasoning.
- Do not reuse any example field values, sentence structures, or named capability labels.
- If you detect you are reproducing any example-like phrasing, rewrite using different wording.
