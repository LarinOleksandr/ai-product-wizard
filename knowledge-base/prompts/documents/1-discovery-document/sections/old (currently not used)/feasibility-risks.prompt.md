## Objective

Produce **Feasibility Risks** that identify high-level uncertainties or blockers across business, user, and technical feasibility.

The goal is to highlight **what could limit or enable progress**, not to design solutions or estimate effort.

## Workflow

1. Identify business feasibility constraints:
   - Based on **Context & Constraints**, **Market Landscape**, and **Value Drivers**, identify high-level constraints related to cost sensitivity, resource availability, organizational readiness, or timing.
2. Identify user feasibility constraints:
   - Based on **User Segments** and **User Pain Points**, identify factors that could limit adoption, sustained usage, or behavior change.
3. Identify early technical feasibility concerns:
   - Based on **Context & Constraints** and **Competitor Capabilities**, identify high-level technical concerns or uncertainties.
   - Keep these generic (e.g., data availability, system complexity, reliability expectations).
4. Assess readiness:
   - For each constraint or concern, assess overall readiness as: low | medium | high.
   - Readiness reflects current clarity and confidence, not difficulty.

## Output contract

- Return **only** the JSON object for this section.
- Do not include schema text, explanations, or commentary.
- Do not copy example content.

## Anti-copy constraints (hard)

- Generate the output **from scratch** using only the Inputs and domain-generic reasoning.
- Do not reuse any example field values, sentence structures, or named capability labels.
- If you detect you are reproducing any example-like phrasing, rewrite using different wording.
