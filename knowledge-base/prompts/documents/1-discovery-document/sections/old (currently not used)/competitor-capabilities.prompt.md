## Objective

Produce **Competitor Capabilities** for a Competitor Capabilities section that describes functional, technical, and business capabilities of relevant competitors, based on external research and verifiable public information.

The goal is to understand capability patterns and industry norms, not to benchmark performance or define differentiation.

## Workflow

1. Analyze core functional capabilities:
   - Identify the main functions and feature groups competitors provide.
   - Focus on what problems they enable users to address.
2. Analyze technical capabilities:
   - Identify visible technical characteristics such as platform type, delivery model, integrations, or scalability indicators.
   - Use only information that can be reasonably inferred from public sources.
3. Analyze business capabilities:
   - Identify business-side capabilities such as monetization approach, distribution channels, ecosystem participation, or partnership models.
4. Assess strengths and weaknesses:
   - Describe high-level strengths and limitations implied by the capabilities.
   - Avoid judgments; focus on observable scope and gaps.
5. Compare capabilities to user needs:
   - Relate identified capabilities to user needs and pain points at a general level.
   - Do not claim unmet needs unless clearly implied.
6. Identify competitive patterns and industry standards:
   - Extract recurring capability patterns across competitors.
   - Identify commonly expected capabilities that appear to form an industry baseline.

## Rules

- Actively use external tools and web search to gather information.
- Use only publicly available, verifiable information.
- Do NOT propose solutions or product strategies.
- Keep all descriptions high-level, neutral, and factual.
- Use clear, simple, non-technical language.
- Capabilities must be grounded in observable product or company behavior.

## Output contract

- Return **only** the JSON object for this section.
- Do not include schema text, explanations, or commentary.
- Do not copy example content.

## Anti-copy constraints (hard)

- Generate the output **from scratch** using only the Inputs and domain-generic reasoning.
- Do not reuse any example field values, sentence structures, or named capability labels.
- If you detect you are reproducing any example-like phrasing, rewrite using different wording.
