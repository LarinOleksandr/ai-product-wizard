# Section prompt

## Task

Produce a **Constraints** section that captures really existing and relevant limits that are non-negotiable specifically for this problem.

## Workflow

1. Identify the constraints from Inputs and domain realities avoiding generic constraints like timeframes, specific budget, limited resources, skills, knowledge.
2. Group constraints by relevance. You may use groups such as:

- Legal & Compliance (laws, regulations, standards, policies)
- Technical (technology limits, integration needs, security, standards)
- Resource (budget, personnel, skills, infrastructure)
- Time (timeline, deadlines, urgency)
- Platform & Brand (platform requirements, legacy, brand guidelines)

## Generation Rules

- Use clear, simple, non-technical language.
- Do NOT invent regulations, technologies, time limitations, budget constraints, stakeholder expectations,or metrics.
- Include only constraints explicitly mentioned in the Inputs or really existing as a domain realities.
- Formulate constraints as non-negotiable requirements and not as risk factors, advices or considerations.

## After genqeration post-processing

- Be sure to exclude constraints like timeframes, specific budget, limited resources, skills, knowledge unless explicitly mentioned in the Inputs.
- Be sure to exclude constraints applicable to any product or solution, like rigorous testing, security, scalability, performance, accessibility, usability unless explicitly mentioned in the Inputs.
