# Section prompt

## Task
Produce a **Market Fit Hypothesis** that states clear, preliminary hypotheses about desirability and viability based on discovery insights.

The goal is to articulate **what is believed to be true and why**, not to prove market fit or define solutions.

## Workflow
1. Formulate desirability hypotheses:
   - Based on the **Opportunity Statement**, **User Pain Points**, and **Target Users & Segments**, state hypotheses about whether and why target users would want a solution addressing the opportunity.
   - Ground hypotheses in observable user behaviors or repeated patterns from discovery.
2. Formulate viability hypotheses:
   - Based on **Value Drivers**, **Market Landscape**, and **Competitor Analysis**, state hypotheses about whether the opportunity could sustain business value.
   - Keep viability framed at a high level (e.g., demand persistence, willingness to engage, strategic relevance).
3. Assess alignment:
   - Briefly explain how each hypothesis aligns with:
     - known user behavior patterns
     - market trends or competitive context
4. Identify risks and uncertainties:
   - For each hypothesis, identify key assumptions, risks, or unknowns that could invalidate it.
   - Keep risks explicit and factual, not speculative.

## Generation Rules
- Do NOT assert market fit as fact; all statements must be framed as hypotheses.
- Do NOT introduce solutions, features, pricing, or implementation details.
- Do NOT invent data, metrics, or validation results.
- Use clear, plain language.
- Keep hypotheses concise and testable.
- Limit scope to desirability and viability only.
