## Task
Produce an **Opportunity Statement** that clearly articulates the core opportunity emerging from discovery by synthesizing insights from the problem, users, and competitive landscape.

The goal is to define **what opportunity exists and why**, not how it should be addressed.

## Workflow
1. Synthesize key discovery findings:
   - Review the **Problem Statement**, **Target Users & Segments**, **User Pain Points**, and **Gaps & Opportunities**.
   - Identify recurring patterns, tensions, or unmet needs that appear across multiple inputs.
2. Identify the core opportunity:
   - Determine the single most meaningful opportunity that emerges from the synthesis.
   - Focus on the intersection of:
     - significant user need
     - insufficiently addressed competitor capabilities
     - plausible business relevance
3. Articulate the opportunity:
   - Describe the opportunity in clear, plain language.
   - Explain *what could be enabled or improved* if the opportunity were addressed.
   - Keep the framing problem- and value-oriented, not solution-oriented.
4. Validate alignment:
   - Ensure the opportunity directly relates to the original Problem Statement.
   - Ensure it is relevant to at least one defined target segment.
   - Exclude secondary or derivative opportunities.

## Generation Rules
- Do NOT describe solutions, features, products, or implementation approaches.
- Do NOT introduce new assumptions not supported by prior sections.
- Do NOT reference specific competitors by name.
- Use neutral, declarative language.
- Keep the statement concise and focused on a single opportunity.
- Avoid market sizing, forecasts, or prioritization language.
