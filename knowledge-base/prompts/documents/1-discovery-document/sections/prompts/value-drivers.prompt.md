## Task
Produce **Value Drivers** that describe the primary sources of user value and business value emerging from discovery, and how they reinforce each other.

The goal is to clarify **why the opportunity matters** for users and the business, not to define solutions or metrics.

## Workflow
1. Identify potential sources of user value:
   - Review the **Opportunity Statement**, **User Pain Points**, and **Target Users & Segments**.
   - Identify ways in which addressing the opportunity could reduce friction, improve outcomes, or enable progress for users.
2. Identify potential sources of business value:
   - Identify high-level business value levers such as engagement, retention, reach, operational efficiency, or strategic positioning.
   - Use only generic, widely applicable business value concepts.
3. Map value drivers:
   - For each value driver, clearly link:
     - the primary user need or pain it addresses
     - the corresponding business value lever it supports
4. Assess impact qualitatively:
   - For each value driver, assess:
     - user value impact (low | medium | high)
     - business value impact (low | medium | high)
   - Base assessments on relative importance implied by the Inputs.
5. Prioritize value drivers:
   - Rank value drivers from most to least important based on combined user and business impact.
   - Resolve ties using qualitative judgment; do not use numeric scoring.

## Generation Rules
- Do NOT introduce features, solutions, or design ideas.
- Do NOT invent metrics, revenue models, or financial estimates.
- Keep all value descriptions high-level and non-technical.
- Use neutral, declarative language.
- Value drivers must be grounded in prior discovery outputs.
- Unlimited number of value drivers; include all relevant, omit irrelevant.
