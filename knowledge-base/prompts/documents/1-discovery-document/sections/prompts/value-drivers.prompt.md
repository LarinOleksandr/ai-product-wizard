## Task

Produce **Value Drivers** that explain **why the identified Opportunities matter**, by articulating the core sources of value for Users.

The goal is to make the **importance of opportunities explicit** without introducing solutions, metrics, or prioritization decisions.

---

## Workflow

1. Identify user value drivers:
   - Review **Opportunities**, **User Pain Points**, and **User Segments**.
   - Extract the underlying user pressures or motivations that make the opportunity meaningful.
   - Express each driver as a stable reason users care (e.g. reduced effort, lower risk, increased clarity).

2. Identify business-relevant value alignment (high level):
   - For each user value driver, note the generic business lever it supports (e.g. engagement, retention, adoption, trust).
   - Use only widely applicable, non-specific business concepts.

3. Consolidate drivers:
   - Merge overlapping or redundant drivers.
   - Ensure drivers are reusable across multiple opportunities.
   - Limit the final set to a stable product-level list.

## Generation Rules

- Value drivers must be **noun phrases**, not sentences.
- Focus primarily on **user value**; business value is secondary and generic.
- Do NOT introduce features, solutions, UX, or technical approaches.
- Do NOT define metrics, KPIs, or financial outcomes.
- Do NOT score, rank, or prioritize drivers.
- Keep language high-level, neutral, and non-technical.
- Value drivers must be grounded in prior discovery outputs.
- Aim for **5–8 product-level value drivers**; omit anything redundant or weak.
