# Section prompt

## Task
Produce a structured **User Pain Points** section that identifies, groups, and qualitatively assesses user pain points strictly based on existing inputs.

## Workflow
1. Collect evidence of user frustrations and unmet needs:
   - Extract explicit or implied difficulties from the Problem Statement and Target Users & Segments.
   - Use only information available at this stage.
2. Identify individual pain points:
   - Describe each pain point in clear, simple language.
   - Avoid inferred emotions, motivations, or behaviors not supported by Inputs.
   - If evidence is weak, frame the pain point as a high-level assumption to be validated later.
3. Group pain points into themes:
   - Combine related pain points under plain-language themes.
   - Themes should help structure the problem space (e.g., “lack of visibility,” “inefficient process”).
4. Assess each pain point qualitatively:
   - Assign **severity**, **frequency**, and **business importance** as: low | medium | high.
   - Base assessments on relative impact implied by the Inputs only.
5. Validate the final list:
   - Each pain point must align with the Problem Statement.
   - Each pain point must clearly reference affected user groups.
   - No overlap with opportunity, solution, or market-level analysis.

## Generation Rules
- Use plain, easy-to-understand language.
- Do NOT introduce solutions, features, benefits, or design ideas.
- Do NOT invent deep insights beyond what Inputs support.
- Pain points must be specific but appropriate for early discovery.
- Characteristics and assessments must remain qualitative.
- No technical jargon or complex terminology.
- Avoid duplication across themes.
