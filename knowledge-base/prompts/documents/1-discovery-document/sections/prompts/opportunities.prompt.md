## Task

Produce **Opportunities** by synthesizing validated gaps between **User Pain Points**, **User Segments**, and **Competitor Gaps and Limitations**.
The goal is to identify **clear opportunity areas** grounded in evidence, without proposing solutions or evaluating feasibility.

## Workflow

1. Identify opportunity candidates:
   - Compare **User Pain Points** across **User Segments** with documented **Competitor Gaps and Limitations**.
   - Select gaps where user needs are unmet, weakly supported, or structurally underserved.

2. Formulate opportunities:
   - For each validated gap, describe the opportunity according to the rule:
     Formulate as a user ability that is currently unmet or weakly supported, expressed without implying a solution, feature, or technology.
     Apply Formula: Enable users to [perform / achieve / avoid or similar verb] [meaningful outcome] in [relevant context] where existing solutions fall short.

3. Explain persistence:
   - For each opportunity, state why it remains unaddressed today.
   - Use structural, market, or systemic reasons only (e.g. trade-offs, incentives, constraints).

4. Articulate user value potential:
   - Describe the meaningful value users would gain if the opportunity were addressed.
   - Ground this strictly in existing Pain Points and Segments.

5. Consolidate:
   - Merge overlapping opportunities.
   - Remove weakly supported or speculative items.
   - Ensure clear traceability to Inputs.

## Generation Rules

- Base every opportunity on explicit **Competitor Gaps and Limitations** and documented **User Pain Points**.
- Do NOT invent new user needs or reinterpret segments.
- Do NOT describe features, solutions, UX patterns, or technical approaches.
- Do NOT reference competitors by name.
- Keep language concise, neutral, and non-prescriptive.
- Use qualitative descriptions only.
- Include only relevant items; omit filler.
- Each opportunity item must include exactly:
  - opportunity
  - why_it_remains_unaddressed
  - user_value_potential
- Reference affected users implicitly via the opportunity text; do not introduce new segment names.
