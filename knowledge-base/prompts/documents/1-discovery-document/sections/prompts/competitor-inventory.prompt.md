# Section prompt

## Task
Produce **Competitors** for a Competitor Inventory section that identifies and organizes direct, indirect, and substitute competitors relevant to the problem space, using external research and verifiable public information.

The goal is comprehensive coverage and clear categorization, not competitive evaluation or differentiation.

## Workflow
1. Identify direct competitors based on the Internet Search Results and your knowledge:
   - Find companies or products that address the same core problem for similar target users.
   - Use external sources (official websites, product pages, reputable articles).
2. Identify indirect competitors:
   - Identify solutions that address the same user needs through different approaches or categories.
   - Include adjacent categories commonly considered by users.
3. Identify substitute competitors:
   - Identify alternatives users may rely on instead of a dedicated product (manual processes, generic tools, offline solutions).
4. Collect competitor profiles:
   - For each competitor, collect:
     - Company or product name
     - Competitor category (direct | indirect | substitute)
     - Short description of what it does
     - Primary target audience (high-level)
     - General positioning (how it presents itself, in plain language)
5. Validate completeness:
   - Ensure competitors are relevant to the Problem Statement and Target Users.
   - Exclude irrelevant, outdated, or marginal players.

## Generation Rules
- Actively use external tools and web search to gather information.
- Use only publicly available, verifiable information.
- Do NOT invent competitors.
- Unlimited number of competitors; include all relevant, omit irrelevant.
- Ensure that these applications are up-to-date for a current year and have a lot of users.
- Return only unique competitors, avoid including web and mobile versions of one app in the list
- Ensure that URLs you include directly lead to app pages.
- Ensure that URLs you include don't lead to error pages or redirects.
- Eliminate URLS that lead to third-party reviews, articles, app stores, or download pages.
