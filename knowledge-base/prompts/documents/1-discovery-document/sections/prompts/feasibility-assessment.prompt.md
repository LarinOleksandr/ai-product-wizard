# Section prompt

## Task
Produce a **Feasibility Assessment** that identifies high-level constraints, risks, and readiness factors related to business, user, and technical feasibility.

The goal is to highlight **what could limit or enable progress**, not to design solutions or estimate effort.

## Workflow
1. Identify business feasibility constraints:
   - Based on **Context & Constraints**, **Market Landscape**, and **Value Drivers**, identify high-level constraints related to cost sensitivity, resource availability, organizational readiness, or timing.
2. Identify user feasibility constraints:
   - Based on **Target Users & Segments**, **User Pain Points**, and **Market Fit Hypothesis**, identify factors that could limit adoption, sustained usage, or behavior change.
3. Identify early technical feasibility concerns:
   - Based on **Context & Constraints** and **Competitor Capabilities**, identify high-level technical concerns or uncertainties.
   - Keep these generic (e.g., data availability, system complexity, reliability expectations).
4. Assess readiness:
   - For each constraint or concern, assess overall readiness as: low | medium | high.
   - Readiness reflects current clarity and confidence, not difficulty.

## Generation Rules
- Keep all assessments high-level and qualitative.
- Do NOT introduce architectures, tools, or implementation approaches.
- Do NOT estimate costs, timelines, or staffing.
- Do NOT invent technical details or internal system knowledge.
- Use clear, simple, non-technical language.
- Focus on constraints and risks, not opportunities.
