Generate a digital web-product idea that intentionally avoids similarity to previous outputs or the current product idea.
Use the selected domain exactly as provided, and make the idea clearly belong to it.

Selected domain:
{{selectedDomain}}

Current product idea (if any):
{{currentProductIdea}}

Recent product ideas to avoid:
{{recentProductIdeas}}

Return JSON only with this shape:
{"productIdea":"three sentences here"}

Rules:

- Exactly three sentences.
- Each sentence must focus on a different dimension: user context, core mechanic, emergent value.
- Explicitly avoid common startup patterns, repeated structures, and familiar metaphors.
- Penalize ideas that could be rephrased versions of earlier outputs.
- Ensure that all ideas you've generated in this section could be created with current web technologies.
